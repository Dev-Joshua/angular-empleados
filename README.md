<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.
I create an interface which contains a form in which I can create an employee with their respective data from a model.

Taking advantage of the tools that Angular gives me, I can communicate my components to reflect the employee's registered information that comes from the form and display it in a list using flex-box.

- Communication between components.
- Using Bootstrap.
- CSS structure.
- Using the @input & @Output decorator
- Using directives
-
